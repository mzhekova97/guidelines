#### Terminal multiplexing

Managing multiple shell tabs or windows can sometimes become painful, especially when working with ROS. In order to minimize this problem, we recommend the utilization of a terminal multiplexer, which allows one to have multiple shells within the same window. See suggestions below:

* [terminator](https://github.com/gnome-terminator/terminator): originally inspired by projects like quadkonsole and gnome-multi-term and more recently by projects like Iterm2, and Tilix, It lets you combine and recombine terminals to suit the style you like. If you live at the command-line, or are logged into 10 different remote machines at once, you should definitely try out Terminator.

* [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux): tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen. tmux may be detached from a screen and continue running in the background, then later reattached. Finally, tmux supports custom configurations. Take a look at [this](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux) if you don't want to waste time configuring it yourself.

#### Git client
Although there other good choices out there, we recommend the utilization of [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/).

#### IDE
We strongly recommend the utilization of [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE.
