## Getting started

If you don't have a github account create one and also setup the SSH keys for your computer and add them to your GitHub account. SSH keys are useful for faster and secure pulling and pushing of your code. See [this guide](https://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/server/ssh/how-to-add-ssh-keys-to-your-github-account/) for setting up your SSH keys.
