# Overview

Python development guidelines.

### Language version

- We use Python 3.

### Containerization

- We encourage the utilization of `virtualenv` for workspace containerization.

- We also encourage every Python workspace to provide a `requirements.txt` containing its first-order dependencies.

### Styleguide

- We follow [Pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

### Linting

Prior to writing any Python code, make sure you have installed [this](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) VSCode extension.

> [!WARNING]
> TODO: Provide ready-to-use `.vscode/settings.json` and linter configurations.
