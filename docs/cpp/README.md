# Overview

C++ development guidelines.

### Language version

- We use C++17.

### Build tools

- Unless what you are developing is extremely simple, we encourage the utilization of [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for build automation.

### Styleguide

- We follow [Bjarne Stroustrup's Core C++ guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/index.html).


### Linting

Prior to writing any C++ code, make sure you have installed [this](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp) VSCode extension.

> [!WARNING]
> TODO: Provide ready-to-use `.vscode/settings.json` and linter configurations.
