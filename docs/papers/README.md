# How To Write Scientific Papers with Impact (IEEE-RAL)
The quality of your research depends on two pillars: originality + relevance. To acheive both one must navigate in a vast ocean of research, identify a vulnerability and exploit it, which is a tremendous effort that requires focus, patience and persistance. After all that work one could think that all the job is done, but there is one last step: Communication. All your efforts are in vain if others can't perceive the relevance and uniqueness of your work, and that's what this tutorial is about. I'll provide patterns and good practices that will help you increase the speed and quality of your papers, and therefore, the chance of being accepted in top journals and conferences. I recommend you to have [my paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08012.pdf) on the side to see a real IEEE-RAL example along the tutorial.

## General advices
Start writing early.

## Structure
Most papers follow a similar structure for a reason: readibility. Editors are used to a particular pattern that allows them to quickly scan your document to get the information they need to evaluate your work. Don't think for a second they're going to read it in order. First, they must decide if your paper is worth reading. Therefore, don't annoy them by changing the standard structure too much, which would look like this one: 
1. Title.
2. Abstract.
3. Introduction.
4. Related Work.
5. Body.
6. Experiments.
7. Conclussions and Future Work.

## Title
Title = contribution.
You must describe your contribution in a single sentece. As simple as possible.

## Abstract
Abstract = teaser.
The abstract should summarize the paper you wrote:
1. Introduction to the problem, highlighting its importance.
2. Your contribution. What have you created to solve the problem?
3. Relevance of your results. How good are your results? How credible are they? Mathematical proof? Only simulation? Real experiments too?

It is very important that you get it right in the title and the abstract. They're going to pre-judge your whole paper based on this. They might not even read the rest!!

### Here is an example:

>An aneurysm in the abdominal aorta will rupture as soon as the wall stress exceeds the wall strength at any location, thus, threatening the patient’s life. Selective surgical repair, however, is costly and risky. Evaluating wall stress to predict the risk of rupture is therefore essential toward patient management, yet current models suffer from several limitations. Using computed tomography and finite elements, we investigated whether the presence of ILT alters the distribution or the magnitude of the wall stress in aneurysms of the abdominal aorta. This article reports the wall stress distribution in twelve patients and discusses the impact of the ILT configuration. In all twelve patients, the presence of an ILT altered the stress distribution and reduced the peak stress by 6 to 38% (p = 0.067), depending on the geometry. As a consequence, it should be taken into account in any patient-specific model of aortic aneurysms for evaluating the wall stress and the risk of rupture. Still, it may also adversely affect the wall strength and will therefore remain the focus of future work.

The above abstract follows this simple structure:

First question to answer: WHY?
1. **Context:** Why something needed to be done at all.
"An aneurysm in the abdominal aorta will rupture as soon as the wall stress exceeds the wall strength at any location, thus, threatening the patient’s life. Selective surgical repair, however, is costly and risky."
2. **Need:** Why the need is so pressing.
"Evaluating wall stress to predict the risk of rupture is therefore essential toward patient management, yet current models suffer from several limitations."
3. **Task:** What was undertaken to address the need
"Using computed tomography and finite elements, we investigated whether the presence of ILT alters the distribution or the magnitude of the wall stress in aneurysms of the abdominal aorta."
4. **Object (body of the paper):** What the present document does (example of keywords: this paper.., here we..).
"This article reports the wall stress distribution in twelve patients and discusses the impact of the ILT configuration."

Second question to answer: SO WHAT?
5. **Findings:** What the findings mean for the audience.
"In all twelve patients, the presence of an ILT altered the stress distribution and reduced the peak stress by 6 to 38% (p = 0.067), depending on the geometry."
6. **Conclusion:** What the work done yielded.
"As a consequence, it should be taken into account in any patient-specific model of aortic aneurysms for evaluating the wall stress and the risk of rupture." 
7. **Perspective:** What the future holds, beyond the work.
"Still, it may also adversely affect the wall strength and will therefore remain the focus of future work."

The abstract shouldn't exceed 300 words.

## Introduction
Here you provide the aim and scope of your paper, highlighting its relevance and summarizing your contributions.
1. Relevance of the field/application. Its potential to create disruptive technologies that solve real-world problems.
2. The problem that stands in the way. Show that many people are doing research on it because of that.
3. What you propose, and its benefits with respect to existing approaches.
4. Bullet list of your contributions.
5. Structure of the paper (optional but preferable).

## Related Work
Here you show that you understood the problem and that you know the state of the art.
1. Specific problem and traditional strategies to attack it.
2. Recent contributions of other authors and their pitfalls.
3. How you have avoided/reduced those pitfalls.

## Body/Object
Here is the body of your work and it is fully yours. If possible, try to make a problem statement, delimiting the scope of your specific problem. Then, if needed, some preliminary results may improve the reading flow of subsequent sections. Whatever you do, try to explain the concepts as easily as possible. The holy grail is to get a simple and elegant solution.
