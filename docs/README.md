# ARG Guidelines

This page contains guideline for the projects carried out at the Automation and Robotics Research Group (ARG). These guidelines are meant to minimize overhead, ensure reproductibility, and favor software reutilization within our team. We count on everyone not only to adopt the standards defined in this page, but also to actively contribute to their specification.
